# WordHTML Clone
[Live Site](https://kembo001.github.io/word-to-html/)

## Features

- **Rich Text Editor**: Format text (bold, italic, underline, lists, etc.) easily.
- **Live HTML Preview**: View generated HTML in real-time.
- **HTML Export**: Copy or download the generated HTML.
- **Clean and Minimal Interface**: User-friendly design for a seamless experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: CSS (or your preferred CSS framework)
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Text Parsing**: DOM manipulation and sanitization libraries (e.g., DOMPurify if needed)
